to help with testing, provide ideas and all kind of suggestions or comments!

* [Absolut](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/absolut) is a VODka plugin, supporting XCAPI.

* [AutoOff](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/autooff) attempts to stop any service after the box goes to standby, and optionally tries to resume the service afterwards - apparently some images don't do it by default, so if you want to confirm, just activate debug and check the debug log. It also supports running commands when entering and exiting standby.

* [Budweiser](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/budweiser) is a simple (and still experimental) audio dubber/PiP: watch a service/channel, mute its sound, enable sound from an external source (e.g., mp3 stream) and optionally introduce a delay to try and synchronize audio and video.

* [Frenchs](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/frenchs) adds some spice to Heinz (see below), marking catchup supporting channels as the M3U download is proxied through it; it supports XCAPI and VAPI.

* [Heinz](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/heinz) is a "ketchup" plugin, supporting (a couple of variants of) XCAPI and VAPI.

* [PyShell](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/pyshell) is a plugin for developers/coders - it provides a very simple Python shell with access to the Enigma2 runtime environment, so small (or not so small) snippets of code can be tested and experimented with while avoiding crashes.

* [QuarterPounder](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/quarterpounder) attempts to monitor IPTV streams and restart them if they get stuck.

* [ReStart](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/restart) is a trivial plugin that stops/starts the current service. No more need to zap out/in.

* [Subway](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/subway) is a plugin to display subscription info, if the service supports it; it should work for both XCAPI and VAPI.

Typically, the README files for each plugin/script will provide the necessary information
regarding where they were developed/tested, so one can make an educated guess if they'd
work on a particular system. In the end, there's nothing like trying it out.

Special thanks and greetings to:
