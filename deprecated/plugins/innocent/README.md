Smooth EXTM3U generator!

The M3U URL for your bouquet maker/editor
should be

    http://127.0.0.1:<port>/

where the <port> parameter comes from the
settings. By default, the port is 8888, so
the URL would be

    http://127.0.0.1:8888/

Remember that, unless static mode is
selected, the M3U needs to be refreshed
no later than every 4 hours, or else the
credentials in it will expire.

Also, beware that forcing refreshes too
often might trigger a temporary block from
the server side, so try not to do it more
often than once an hour.

For Suls, make sure the bouquets will be
generated as HLS/M3U8 (IPTV type 4097,
eventually 5002 or even 5001 if you installed
serviceapp).


Big thanks to @duoduo80 for all the
testing and experimenting endured!!!
